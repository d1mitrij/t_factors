## Overview

The **Transition Factors (T-Factors)** framework provides a complete system for measuring, attributing, and managing environmental and social impacts across portfolios. Aligned to **GBF**, **TNFD**, **TCFD**, **ISSB**, **SBTN**, **SDGs**, and **COSO ERM**, it enables decision-useful impact valuation for investment, risk management, and sustainability reporting - from asset-level impact to portfolio-level finance to enterprise strategy.

## The 13 Impact Indicators

### Environmental (8)
1. **GHG Emissions** - $0.05-$0.15/kg CO₂e (SCC, Nordhaus DICE)
2. **Air Pollution** - $1-$25/kg (UBA damage costs, income-elastic)
3. **Water Consumption** - $2-$80/m³ (AWARE-scaled scarcity)
4. **Water Pollution** - $10-$300/kg (Steen EPS + USEtox)
5. **Land Use** - $300k-$3.7M/ha (EPS ecosystem services + LANCA)
6. **Waste** - $0.02-$2.50/kg (management cost + externality)
7. **Biodiversity** - Research phase (PDF-based)
8. **Soil Quality** - Research phase (erosion + carbon loss)

### Social (5)
9. **OHS** - $1.6k-$4.4M/incident (DALY × global uniform VSL-Y)
10. **Training** - $12-$90/hour (returns to education)
11. **Living Wage** - Research ($12k-$22k/worker-year deficit)
12. **Forced Labour** - Planned ($130k/worker-year, preliminary)
13. **Child Labour** - Planned ($50k/child-year, preliminary)

## Core Principles

### 1. Backward vs. Forward-Looking

**Backward-Looking** (2014-2030):
- Single source of truth
- Historical observed coefficients
- Regulatory compliance (ESRS, CSRD)

**Forward-Looking** (2030-2100):
- Multiple truths (scenario-dependent)
- Transition & physical risk pathways
- Strategic resilience (TCFD, TNFD)

---

### 2. Asset vs. Portfolio Attribution

**Asset Impact** (Playbooks 1-3):
```
Asset_Impact = IVF × EF × VF
```
- 100% located at the asset
- Independent of financing structure

**Portfolio Attribution** (Playbook 5):
```
Portfolio_Impact = Σ (Asset_Impact × Attribution_Share)

Where Attribution_Share depends on:
- Control (>50% ownership → 100%)
- Instrument type (equity %, EVIC-based debt %)
- Risk exposure (first-loss, guarantees)
```

**Critical**: Asset impact answers "what happens." Portfolio attribution answers "who accounts for it."

## Implementation Workflow

**Step 1**: Collect asset exposure data with regional databases (Playbook 2)

**Step 3**: Apply scenarios including SBTN-validated transitions (Impact × VF) (Playbook 3)
**Step 4**: Attribute to portfolio (Playbook 5)
**Step 5**: Calculate financial risk via TIR & contingent liabilities (Playbook 6)
**Step 6**: Integrate into transition strategy with GBF-TNFD-ENCORE alignment (Playbook 7)
**Step 7**: Report & assure (Playbook 4)
