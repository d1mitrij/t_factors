"Database Name","Playbook Context","Indicator(s)","Short Description","Suggested CSV Access"
"GBF Monitoring Framework Indicators","**Playbook 1 (IVF) & Playbook 7 (Strategy)**. The GBF indicators are the national-level targets that inform the societal value of impacts in the IVFs. Playbook 7 uses these global goals to shape corporate transition strategies.","Headline Indicators such as 'Extent of natural ecosystems' (A.2), 'Services provided by ecosystems' (B.1), and pollution indices (Target 7).","A set of globally agreed upon indicators used by countries to report progress against the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework's 23 targets.","The data is available through national portals or the UN Biodiversity Lab. For direct CSVs, query the specific indicator on the GBF Indicators repository (gbf-indicators.org) and look for data export options."
"ENCORE (Exploring Natural Capital Opportunities, Risks and Exposure)","**Playbook 2 (Exposure) & Playbook 6 (Finance)**. ENCORE is the primary tool for identifying an asset's dependencies on nature (e.g., a beverage company's dependency on water). This informs the risk assessment in Playbook 2 and the financial analysis (TIR) in Playbook 6.","Ecosystem Service Dependencies (e.g., Water Supply, Flood Mitigation); Impact Drivers (e.g., Land Use, Water Use).","A tool from UNEP-WCMC that scientifically maps over 160 economic sectors to their dependencies on 21 ecosystem services and their impacts on nature. It acts as a bridge between economic activity and natural capital.","The core dependency and impact data can be downloaded directly from the ENCORE website (encorenature.org). The 'Data & Methodology' section typically provides access to the underlying database in CSV or Excel format."
"WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas","**Playbook 1 (IVF) & Playbook 2 (Exposure)**. The AWARE water scarcity factors used in the Water Consumption IVF (Playbook 1) are derived from the same underlying data. Playbook 2 uses Aqueduct to identify high-risk facilities in water-stressed basins (the 'Locate' step).","Baseline Water Stress, Groundwater Stress, Interannual Variability.","A global geospatial database from the World Resources Institute that maps various dimensions of water risk at a high resolution. It is a standard tool for corporate water risk assessment and stewardship.","Go to the WRI Aqueduct website (wri.org/aqueduct). The 'Data' or 'Download' section allows you to download country-level and basin-level risk indicators as CSV files. Free registration may be required."
"IBAT (Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool)","**Playbook 2 (Exposure) & Playbook 3 (Vulnerability)**. IBAT is used in the 'Locate' phase to check if assets are near Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) or protected areas. This informs exposure in Playbook 2 and increases the Vulnerability Factor (VF) in Playbook 3 for those assets.","Proximity to Protected Areas, Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), and IUCN Red List Species ranges.","A subscription-based tool providing access to three core global biodiversity datasets: the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the World Database on Protected Areas, and the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas.","IBAT is a commercial service. A corporate subscription is required. Once subscribed, users can run portfolio screening analysis and export the results, which often include proximity assessments to sensitive sites, as a CSV file."
"IUCN Red List of Ecosystems","**Playbook 1 (IVF) & Playbook 7 (Strategy)**. As a headline GBF indicator, this provides the 'risk' or 'quality' dimension for the Land Use IVF in Playbook 1. An impact on a 'Critically Endangered' ecosystem receives a much higher monetary value. Playbook 7 uses this to prioritize conservation efforts.","Ecosystem risk category (from 'Least Concern' to 'Collapsed').","A global standard for assessing the risk of ecosystem collapse, analogous to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It provides a scientific measure of an ecosystem's health and integrity.","The assessment data is available on the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems website. Look for a data download portal or repository. While much of the data is spatial, summary tables are often available as CSV or can be exported from their online tools."
"UN Biodiversity Lab","**Playbook 1 (IVF), Playbook 2 (Exposure), Playbook 7 (Strategy)**. This is a central data platform providing many of the global spatial datasets that underpin the GBF indicators. It provides raw data for calculating IVFs (e.g., land cover change) and assessing exposure (e.g., location of assets relative to ecosystems).","Over 400 global, national, and sub-national geospatial data layers, including forest cover, protected areas, and human pressure indices.","A data platform by UNDP, UNEP, and the CBD Secretariat providing open-access global biodiversity data to support national reporting and planning for the GBF.","The platform (unbiodiversitylab.org) is primarily spatial. To obtain CSV data, you would typically define a project area (e.g., a country or region), run an analysis (e.g., calculate the area of different land cover types), and then export the resulting statistical summary table as a CSV."
